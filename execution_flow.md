# 🔄 SUS Execution Flow — Architecture Blueprint

This document outlines the **core logic flow** and **execution pipeline** of the SUS (Self-Updating System) architecture. It ensures clarity on how each module interacts across validation, refinement, memory, and task systems.

---

## 🌐 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

USER INPUT
↓
[ trigger.py ]
↓
[ sus_memory.json ] ←→ [ sus_tasks.json ]
↓
[ refine_loop.py ] — background self-correction
↓
[ validate.py ] — file + module health checks
↓
[ sync_to_notion.py ] / [ git sync ] (manual/auto)
↓
[ LLM_Connector_Modules.py ] ←→ [ Continuous_Simulator.py ]

---

## ⚙️ MODULE-LEVEL EXECUTION PATH

### 1. `trigger.py`
- Accepts user/system-triggered actions.
- Writes to `sus_memory.json`, updates task queues.
- Example:  
  ```bash
  python3 trigger.py --add-memory "Auto-init new tool"

2. sus_memory.json / sus_tasks.json
	•	Serve as centralized persistent memory and task logic storage.
	•	Used by every major component in decision-making and execution.

3. refine_loop.py
	•	Continuously loops through tools and files for:
	•	Syntax integrity
	•	Missing logic
	•	Placeholder detection
	•	Executes refinement cycles and logs outcomes.

4. validate.py
	•	Validates the entire directory:
	•	Confirms all required files exist
	•	Auto-generates any that are missing
	•	Logs status into cycle_summary.log

5. sync_to_notion.py (Paused)
	•	Syncs Markdown files into Notion using API tokens or folder watch.
	•	Only triggered after file validation completes.

6. LLM_Connector_Modules.py / Continuous_Simulator.py
	•	(WIP) Link to external AI tools for model simulation + intelligent scaling.
	•	Acts as AI-optimized execution managers across sessions or tasks.

⸻

✅ SUCCESS PATH

✔ trigger.py invoked
✔ Memory/task written
✔ refine_loop.py runs
✔ All files validated
✔ New logic injected
✔ Manual sync → GitHub / Notion (when active)
✔ Feedback loop complete



⸻

⚠️ FAILURE STATES

Stage	Issue	Solution
trigger.py	Unknown command	Check --help flags
refine_loop.py	ImportError, missing logic	Regenerate or sync files
validate.py	Missing files	Auto-created, then re-validate
sync_to_notion.py	Placeholder or auth fail	Resume after file completion



⸻

🧩 MODULE DEPENDENCIES
	•	refine_loop.py ➝ depends on: validate.py, trigger.py
	•	sync_to_notion.py ➝ depends on: validate.py, Notion auth
	•	deploy_sus.sh ➝ executes all setup scripts
	•	tool_docs.md ➝ reflects live module documentation

🧠 RECOMMENDATION

Keep this file pinned or printed. Use it to verify correct flow and identify failure points during development or deployment.

Let me know when you're ready and I’ll continue with the **next file** in the pipeline.

Meanwhile, the SUS engine continues refining all other modules silently in the background.
